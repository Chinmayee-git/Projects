Previous Experience : I an well acquainted with the basics of c, c++, python and java language. I have worked with a few libraries under python like pygame, opencv, Beautiful Soup, Selenium, matplotlib, etc. I am also familiar with basic linux commands.

Current PoRs : MEA Coordinator under spons, pr and events team.

Why I want to work in the team : The kind of work Abhiyaan does is very fascinating. I've always been interested in ROS and autonomous vehicles and am keen to learn more about them. I would love to learn more about that by being a part of the team. I love to code and I wanted a coding based PoR and I thought this would be the best fit for it. I thoroughly enjoyed working on the application and I got to know a lot of new things while doing so.
